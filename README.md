Mojo Hack
=========

# Design notes

* Hack is a 16-bit computer described in the book Elements of Computing Systems.
* In my implementation, the *rising* edge of the clock will advance registers.
* This Hack machine will not have the usual screen and keyboard.
  Instead it will have a 1 register display (4 hex characters), and
  16 buttons. More on this later.

# To Do

* Build RAM32K.
* Build 'computer' module.
* Decide how to get programs into ROM.
* Decide how to memory map the LEDs.

# Very long term

* Can I do VGA output? That would be cool.
